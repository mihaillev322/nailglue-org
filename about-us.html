<h1>About Nail Glue: evidence-led nail adhesive guidance</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Mission and scope (international)</h2>
<p>Nail Glue is an independent educational resource dedicated to providing clear, evidence-led guidance on nail adhesive products, application techniques, safety practices, and removal methods. Our mission is to help individuals worldwide make informed decisions about strong nail adhesive products, whether they are applying press-on nails at home, working with professional nail glue for extensions, or seeking safer alternatives for sensitive nails.</p>

<p>We serve an international audience across diverse climates, regulatory environments, and beauty traditions. Our content is designed to be neutral, practical, and accessible—free from commercial bias, affiliate marketing, or brand promotion. We recognize that nail glue brands, formulations, and availability vary significantly by region, so we focus on universal principles: ingredient families (primarily cyanoacrylate-based adhesives), application best practices, realistic drying time and cure expectations, water resistance characteristics, and nail glue removal methods that protect natural nails.</p>

<p>The scope of Nail Glue encompasses all common use cases for nail adhesive: attaching artificial nail tips, securing acrylic extensions, applying press-on manicures, and emergency nail repairs. We address frequently asked questions about long lasting nail glue performance, the difference between set time and full cure, waterproof nail adhesive claims, and the critical distinction between nail glue and nail polish. Our goal is to demystify these products and empower readers to achieve safe, repeatable results regardless of their experience level or geographic location.</p>

<p>We are committed to transparency in our editorial process, regular content updates to reflect evolving safety standards, and responsiveness to reader questions and corrections. Nail Glue does not sell products, accept advertising, or receive compensation from manufacturers. Our independence allows us to prioritize accuracy, safety, and user outcomes above all else.</p>

<section id="methodology">
<h2>How we evaluate nail glue brands and claims</h2>
<p>Our evaluation methodology is grounded in a systematic review of ingredient families, packaging design, usability factors, performance characteristics, and safety considerations. When assessing nail glue brands and formulations, we examine the following criteria to ensure our guidance reflects real-world use and international best practices.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredient families and chemistry:</strong> Most nail adhesives are based on cyanoacrylate polymers, the same family used in medical and industrial super glues. We distinguish between ethyl cyanoacrylate (faster setting, stronger odor) and other variants that may offer lower fumes or extended working time. Understanding these chemical foundations helps us explain why certain products perform differently and why ventilation and skin contact precautions are universally important.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and application control:</strong> We evaluate whether a product uses a brush applicator, precision nozzle, or dropper tip, and how these designs affect the ability to apply minimal product accurately. Controlled application is essential for avoiding cuticle flooding, reducing fume exposure, and achieving a clean bond. We also consider cap design, seal integrity, and shelf-life indicators that affect product longevity and user safety.</p>

<p><strong>Drying time versus full cure:</strong> Marketing claims often conflate initial set time (when the adhesive feels dry to the touch, typically 30 seconds to 2 minutes) with full cure (when maximum bond strength and water resistance are achieved, often 12 to 24 hours). We clarify these distinctions and set realistic expectations for wear duration under routine conditions such as handwashing, showering, and exposure to household chemicals.</p>

<p><strong>Water resistance and durability:</strong> We assess claims about waterproof nail adhesive performance by considering both the chemistry of cured cyanoacrylate and the practical realities of prolonged water exposure. While fully cured nail glue is generally water-resistant, repeated soaking, hot water, and detergents can gradually weaken bonds. We provide context for these trade-offs rather than endorsing absolute claims.</p>

<p><strong>Removal impact and aftercare:</strong> A responsible evaluation of any nail glue for extensions or press-ons must include the ease and safety of removal. We prioritize products and techniques that minimize damage to the natural nail plate and cuticle, and we document nail glue removal methods that balance efficiency with gentleness. Forced removal or inadequate soaking can cause splitting, peeling, and long-term nail health issues.</p>

<p><strong>Safety and accessibility:</strong> We review product labeling for clear safety warnings, storage instructions, and first-aid guidance. We also consider accessibility factors such as odor intensity (important for individuals with respiratory sensitivities), packaging readability, and the availability of lower-toxicity or hypoallergenic formulations. Our goal is to help readers select long lasting nail glue options that align with their health needs and risk tolerance.</p>

<p>This methodology is applied consistently across all content on Nail Glue, ensuring that our guidance on nail glue brands, application techniques, and safety practices is both rigorous and practical for an international readership.</p>
